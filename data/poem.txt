                                                                                
                                                                                          
  voices in the night                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
  there were voices in the night                                                                                
  when I was young                                                                                
  once a month, when the moon was full                                                                                
  I would hear my name in the dark                                                                                
  as I fell asleep                                                                                 
  I did not recognize the voice                                                                                
  it was the voice of a woman                                                                                   
  perhaps is was some ghost or goblin                                                                                                                                 
  or perhaps it was only my brain digesting                                                                                 
  some oversized snack                                                                                 
  on a dark windy, moonlit night
