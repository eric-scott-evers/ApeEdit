Why so many levels? 
To facilitate testing and other utility functions such as
    - group editing
    - debugging
    - testing  
    - utility plugins 

Utility functions in NaCl editor:

Execute line of erlang code 
    - use ^x-e to execute line of code in erlang 
    - code can access some information about editor via ets database
    - code lives in its own environment, so variables live as long as an edit session
    - code runs in controled process and replies "crash" is code fails.
