                                                                                 
Your Eyes                                                                                
                                                                                
your eyes blaze in my mind like high-lights on the water                                                                                 
on a sunny windy day                                                                                
                                                                                
your eyes run around a la wild animal looking for food or                                                                                
a young one, or some exotic nexting material                                                                                
                                                                                
I love the way your eyes look, when they look for me,                                                                                 
looking for you, looking for me
